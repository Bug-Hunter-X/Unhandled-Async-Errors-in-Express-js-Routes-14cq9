# Unhandled Async Errors in Express.js Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations within route handlers.  Failing to catch and handle errors in asynchronous functions can lead to unexpected server crashes and a poor user experience.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases a route handler that uses an asynchronous function (`someAsyncOperation`). This function simulates an operation that might throw an error.  However, the code lacks proper error handling within the `.catch` block.  If the asynchronous operation fails, the error is only logged to the console; the server doesn't respond to the client, and the error might not be easily detectable.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version.  It includes comprehensive error handling within the `.catch` block, providing a more robust and user-friendly experience:

1. **Proper Error Handling:** Catches potential errors and sends an appropriate response to the client (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error with a helpful message).
2. **Detailed Logging:** Logs the error with context for easier debugging.

This improved error handling ensures that the server remains stable and provides informative feedback to users when unexpected issues occur.
